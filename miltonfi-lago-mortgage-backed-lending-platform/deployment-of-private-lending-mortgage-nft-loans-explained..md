# Deployment of private lending mortgage : NFT loans explained.

Once USDC is deposited in the Lago lending platform, MiltonFi exchanges it for USD and lends using the traditional mortgage lending framework.

For each loan, an NFT is created with the loan characteristics:&#x20;

* Loan Amount&#x20;
* Rate
* Amortization period&#x20;
* Repayment schedule

And the privatized NFT is linked on-chain for transparency to the community on the amounts lent.
